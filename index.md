# About the game

## The idea

At the begining, we had a dance pad, and of course, we played Stepmania. But we
felt that the potential of the controller isn't fully exploited. So we tried to
think of a game that would utilize the dance pad in a new, more complex way.
What could be controlled with your feet, while stood on? Suddenly, it was clear
– we will be making a magic carpet flight simulator.

## The game

You are a genie. You were summoned from a bottle to fulfill a wish. To complete
your task, you may only use your flying carpet. You can't die, you can't fail,
you can't deny the request and you can't escape, since all your world is just
the inside of another bottle. Only after you grant the summoner his wish, you
are free to leave, to a bigger world in a bigger bottle. There is no hurry
then, you may as well relax and enjoy the ride.

# System requirements

## Platform

Windows PC with DirectX 9 compliant video card

## Controller

Dance pad or Keyboard

Note that Magic Dance Dance Carpet doesn't support dance pad control directly.
If you want to play the game the way it was intended, you need to use a
keyboard emulation utility, for example GlovePIE or JoyToKey. GlovePIE with an
appropriate configuration file is bundled with the game.
